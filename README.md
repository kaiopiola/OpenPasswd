# OpenPasswd

## What is this?
OpenPasswd is a simple open-source password generator built with React. You have some options like length, special characters, numbers, uppercase and lowercase text.

## Why are you building this?
I'm studying React and this is one of my projects I use to practice, I just liked it and decided to turn it public.
It was the first project I've entirely written in the GitHub Codespaces!

## Where can I test it?
You can clone this repo and test it for yourself, or just wait for me to publish it on Vercel under a domain.

## Roadmap
I want to recreate my [PHP Keygen-Package](https://github.com/kaiopiola/keygen-package) as a NPM package on future, and I'll implement it on this project.
